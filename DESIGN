iPSQL design
============

This document specifies concept of intelligent PostgreSQL shell.

Planned features
----------------

List of planned features:

    * Vi-mode and Emacs-mode line editing facilities.

    * Syntax highlighting.

    * Contextual completion.

    * Own parser for SQL with fallback to PostgreSQL parser (allow better
      experiments with language).

    * Better interface with pagers (search by columns, maybe).

    * Better interface with editors (streamline completion).

    * Alternative query syntax (HTSQL maybe?).

    * Async operations.

    * Configurable prompt.

    * Possible macro support (loops, conditionals).
